      <p>
        I am a fifth year PhD student in number theory. My advisor is Neal Koblitz. Much of my research centers
        on finding parameters for elliptic curve cryptosystems with special properties.

      </h3>
      <p>
        I am a member of the University of Washington chapter of the Association for Women in Mathematics. I
        fully support equality in STEM fields.

      <p>
        The Washington Experimental Math Lab is an oppurtunity for teams of undergraduates to work on a project
        in math research with graduate student and faculty mentors. I have mentored the following projects.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Fall 2017: Rational Points on Curves
          <p>
            Learn about diophantine equations such as Pell's equation and Thue equations. Solutions to these equations
            have algebraic, analytic, and geometric interpretations. The goal of the project is to eventually
            search for rational points on higher genus curves (with genus at least 2). The results of
            the search will be compared with the uniformity conjecture.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Spring 2017: Atkin-Goldwasser-Kilian elliptic Curve Primality Test
          <p>
            Implement the elliptic curve primality test (which requires an implementation of Schoof's point counting
            algorithm on curves over finite rings) and compare timings with the previous primality tests.
            This requires learning some background on elliptic curve arithmetic.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Winter 2017: Agrawal–Kayal–Saxena primality Test
          <p>
            Implement the AKS primliaty test in Sage. Compare timings against brute force and standard probabilistic
            primality tests.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Fall 2016: Experimental Evidence for the Bateman-Horn Conjecture
          <p>
            Use Sage to gather evidence for the Bateman-Horn conjecture which gives an asymptotic density for how
            often a finite set of polynomials takes on prime values.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          Spring 2016: Wikipedia Taskforce
          <p>
            Contribute sequences to The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences® (OEIS®) database and new images
            of graphs to wikipedia articles.
          </p>

        <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/uwconf/wordpress/mathday/">Math Day</a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        Math Day is an event for over a thousand high school students to come to UW and see some lectures about
        math/science. I have volunteered at Math Day the past four years.
        <!--2014,2015,2016,2017-->
        The past three years I have led the Sage workshop, which gives students a chance to explore programming
        and math. I have written my own cryptography focused worksheet so that they can also be exposed
        to some math behind modern cryptography.

        The Julia Robinson Math Festival is an event for elementary through high school students to visit UW
        and explore math. I have volunteered at the festival the past three years.

      <h4>Teaching Assistant/Instructor University of Washington (2013 - present)</h4>
      <p>
        As a teaching assitant, I grade exams, lead quiz sections, and hold office hours. I also teach my own
        classes where I am responsible for writing exams and assigning final grades.
      </p>
      <h4>Web Developer, University of Washington (2015-2017)</h4>
      <p>
        Lead developer, project manager, product designer, graphic designer, UI/UX developer, quality assurance,
        and support for Hamstr: an online math homework system. https://hamstr.org
      </p>
      <h4>Contract Web Designer (2013-2016)</h4>
      <p>
        I helped build and redesign websites for professors in math education at Virginia Tech, University California
        at San Diego, and Portland State University. This included rewriting HTML and CSS as well as
        implementing discussion boards and user accounts in PHP.
